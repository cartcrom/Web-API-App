# Web API App
This is a group project from a web programming class during my senior year of highschool.<br />
It was created using node js deployed with heroku.<br />
Based on the subreddit "/r/place", users may upload images to a canvas on our site. Everyone else can see their image.<br />
User data is saved through MongoDB using Mlab.<br />
This version of our app ensures that only pictures of dogs are uploaded, using Google's image filter API.<br />
